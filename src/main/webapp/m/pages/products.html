							When you are selling or buying products online, you want to ensure the secure handling of your and your customers payment information.<br>
							Payment security has become one of the biggest problems during the last years. 
							Especially in the United States theft of payment information has been happening more and more often.  
							Most companies treat payment information with not enough of no security at all.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Payment security standards in the US are available but rarely used. 
							Most companies treat credit card information as an ID of their customers, therefore saving all given information and making theft possible. 
							In Europe security standards are licensed and used more often. 
							Security of payment information ensures theft as almost impossible and/or ensures stolen payment information can not be used at all.<br> 
							&nbsp;<br>
							The 'SFWS Payment Service' is a tool using one of the most used european security standard called:<br>
							<div class="centered"><img align="top" alt="SF Web Solution - Logo" src="../utils/images/pcicompliance-329x192.png" border="0" width="205px"></div>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Using this above security standard, the tool can be used as a web- or web service interface, for any kind of transaction involving payment data (including credit card, invoice, bank debit and PayPal payment).<br>
							Payment Information is only held during time of transaction, deleted right after completion and cannot be requested fully visible at any time after submission (using 'PCI Tokenization').<br>
							Payment information is able to be saved (customer specific database), but cannot be requested fully visible at any time after submission (using 'PCI Tokenization').<br>
							Saved payment information is always held using a double encryted database and additional encrpytion data storage.   
							Not all information is held online (CVC number is not allowed to be saved at any time using 'PCI Security Standards'). 
							Even in case of an online theft, saved payment information (card numbers, bank accounts, etc.) cannot be used, as they are incomplete.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							This is be a company created product.<br>
							<b>Planned release-date for this tool: July 2015</b><br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Please check back periodically to check for updates and other changes.<br>
							In the near future this space will contain additional information about the tool, 
							as well as links to 'PCI' and additional manuals.<br>
